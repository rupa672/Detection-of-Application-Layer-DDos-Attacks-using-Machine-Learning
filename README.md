# Detection-of-Application-Layer-DDos-Attacks-Produced-by-Various-Freely-Accessible-ToolKits-Using-Machine Learning
**Problem Statement**

One of the most pernicious and increasingly complex security dangers to computer networks is distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.The increasing prevalence of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks poses a significant threat to online services. While numerous studies have focused on identifying attack patterns, there is a notable gap in understanding the role of freely available DDoS attack tools in
exacerbating these threats. This research aims to address this gap by investigating the impact of such tools on the frequency and severity of attacks. Furthermore, it seeks to develop an efficient machine learning-based solution for DDoS attack detection through feature selection, contributing to enhanced cybersecurity measures.
